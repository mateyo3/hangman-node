## Successes
1. JSON package create with inquirer dependency 
2. Read external text file and convert data into and array
3. Randomly select data from text file and convert into an array of letters and replace with undescores

## Incomplete code
1. Random word, secret word with underscores, letters guessed, and guess remaining do not get printed after inquirer prompt completes
2. User input guesses do not get pushed into array to be checked whether or not they selected the correct or incorrect letter

## Other issues
1. When spliting randomword into an array of strings, the length is counted with one extra index. For example, in [a,r,m] the length is counting 4 objects in the array.

## Built With
